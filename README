# status

in development.  starting to become useable.


# intro

nfssrv is an nfs server for inferno, written in limbo.  it comes
with a portmapper.  nfssrv also serves the mnt protocol.  only nfs
version 3 is supported, and only the operations that make sense on
inferno (e.g. no (sym)links or special files).  nfssrv serves the
local file system, meaning all access is done as the user who started
nfssrv.


# install

first, ensure a "mkconfig" file is present.  a bind/symlink to the
mkconfig of your inferno install should do.  now "mk install" to
compile and install the files.

# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo

- fix code in readdir(plus) so we never send too large responses
- fix file handle cache eviction scheme
- cache opened files
- cleanup cached open directories
- rpc message should hold source address (ip, port, proto)
- see if Weakdata(nil,nil) can be filled in.  other optional data too perhaps.
- think whether we can force clients to treat synthetic files
  properly by sending the right non-caching responses (e.g. no new
  attributes after an operation).
