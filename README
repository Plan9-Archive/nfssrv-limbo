# status

starting to become useable.


# intro

this package contains nfssrv and nfsfs, an nfs server and client,
for inferno and written in limbo.  it uses and comes with a library
for parsing/packing nfs protocol messages.  a portmapper and mnt
service is included too.  only nfs version 3 is supported, and only
the operations that make sense on inferno (e.g. no (sym)links or
special files).  see the manual pages for more information.


# install

first install "util".

modify mkconfig if you don't have $ROOT set.  now "mk install" to
compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- nfsfs: determine if we need to do some verification (cookies)
- nfsfs: should we use restricted ports?
- nfssrv: implement worker threads and allow responding to messages out of order?
- nfssrv: rpc message should hold source address (ip, port, proto)
- nfssrv: see if Weakdata(nil,nil) can be filled in.  other optional data too perhaps.
