# status

in development.  starting to become useable.


# intro

this package contains nfssrv and nfsfs, an nfs server and client,
for inferno and written in limbo.  it uses and comes with a library
for parsing/packing nfs protocol messages.  a portmapper and mnt
service is included too.  only nfs version 3 is supported, and only
the operations that make sense on inferno (e.g. no (sym)links or
special files).  nfssrv serves the local file system, meaning all
access is done as the user who started nfssrv.


# install

first install "util".

modify mkconfig if you don't have $ROOT set.  now "mk install" to
compile and install the files.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- nfsfs: determine if we need to do some verification (cookies)
- nfsfs: should we use restricted ports?
- nfssrv: support serving multiple users, each with their own mount of an fd (with their /dev/user).
- nfssrv: implement worker threads and allow responding to messages out of order?
- nfssrv: rpc message should hold source address (ip, port, proto)
- nfssrv: see if Weakdata(nil,nil) can be filled in.  other optional data too perhaps.
