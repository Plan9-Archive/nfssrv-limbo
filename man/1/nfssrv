.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Nfssrv
is an NFSv3 server, it also serves the mount protocol.  It exports files served by
.I styxfile
over NFS.
.PP
Nfssrv
can operate in stateless and almost-stateless mode.  In stateless mode (when
.B -S
is specified) all NFS file handles are mapped directly to the
``qid path'' of a file.  In this case
.I styxfile
must be a special file server that allows file look ups by ``qid
path''.  See below for details.  In almost-stateless mode, paths
up to 63 bytes long are stateless, beyond that they are not.  This
can be problematic for clients that do not properly look up stale file
handles.
.PP
Nfssrv only maps NFS uids and gids (integers) to styx uids and gids (strings) when
.B -t
has been specified.  With
.B -t
it also executes NFS requests with the permissions of the user name
(after translation from NFS uid).  It does this by mounting the
file system servec by
.I styxfile
once for each user that connects.  Without
.B -t
all file operations are executed as the user that started nfssrv.
.PP
Since Styx does not support ``special files'', such as (sym)links
or device nodes, operations involving such file types are not
supported.
.PP
At startup, nfssrv registers itself with the portmapper through
.IR /chan/portmapper .
.SS Options
.TP
.B -c
After NFS file operations such as ``read'' and ``write'', return
the new attributes of the file, to let the client better implement
``weak cache consistency''.
.TP
.B -d
Print debug output.
.TP
.B -D
Print NFS message traces.
.TP
.B -s
Stay in foreground.  By default nfssrv runs in the background after having claimed tcp & udp ports.
.TP
.BI -h " host"
Listen on
.IR host .
The default is ``*''.
.TP
.BI -n " nfsport"
Listen on port
.I nfsport
for the NFS server, 2049 by default.
.TP
.BI -m " mntport"
Listen on port
.I mntport
for the mnt service, 39422 by default.
.TP
.BI -p " udp|tcp"
Listen only for the specified protocol,
.I udp
or
.IR tcp .
Nfssrv listens for both protocols by default.
.TP
.BI -t " user group"
Read the files
.I user
and
.I group
in common unix passwd and groups format and use it for mapping NFS
uids and gids (integers) to styx uids and gids (strings).  The styx
user name (after translation from an NFS uid) is used in the styx
attach message too, to enforce user permissions.
If this option is not specified, styx names are all mapped to ``0'',
and user id's are all mapped to ``none''.
.TP
.BI -S " aname anameup mtpt mtptup rootqidpath"
Instead of mounting
.I styxfile
for normal files, mount it twice, once with attach specifier
.I aname
on
.I mtpt
and once with
.I anameup
on
.IR mtptup .
Use these paths to open files by their ``qid path'' and looking up
the parent of a ``qid path'' respectively.  The file server behind
.I styxfile
must treat walks to hexadecimal numbers in its root directory as
walks to the file with the ``qid path'' represented by that number.
The root of the exported file system is represented by
.IR rootqidpath .

.SH BUGS
Nfssrv does not try to be too smart.  For example, it does not have a duplicate request cache.
