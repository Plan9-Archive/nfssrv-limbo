.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Nfsfs
is an nfs client.  Styx is served on its standard input.  Styx requests are implemented using nfs messages.  The root file system served by
nfsfs is
.I path
from
.I host.
At startup, nfsfs dials (with tcp) the portmap service at
.IR host ,
to find the tcp ports the mount and nfs protocols are served on at
.IR host .
The mount service is dialed to get a root file handle for
.IR path .
.B Nfsfs
then dials the nfs service and uses that connection to implement the styx operations.
.PP
Nfsfs also provides access to nfs file system information through the read-only files
.I /chan/nfsinfo
and
.IR /chan/nfsstat .
.SS Options
.TP
.B -d
Print debugging information.
.TP
.BI -u " uid"
Perform portmap, mnt and nfs operations as
.IR uid .
The default is 0.
.TP
.BI -g " gid,..."
Perform portmap, mnt and nfs operations as
.IR gid,... .
The default is 0.
.TP
.BI -p " passwd group"
Read a mapping of user names to uids (and back) from
.I passwd
and from group names (and back) from
.IR group .
By default, numeric id's are used.
The format of the files is the common unix password and group file format.

.SH BUGS
No caching (e.g. for attributes).  Each fid has one file handle cached, stale file handles are refreshed by one lookup per path element, from the root file handle.
.br
Does not dial from ports < 1024.
.br
Handles each styx message synchronously, so no concurrently styx or nfs operations.
.br
Only operates over TCP, for the portmap, mount and nfs protocols.
